    <h1>This is a main heading</h1>
    And this is a normal text.
    <p>This is a paragraph...</p>

        <h2>This is a subheading</h2>
        <p>This is a paragraph in a subheading...</p>

            <h3>This is a heading level 3</h3>
                <h4>This is a heading level 4</h4>
    
    <h1>Headings give an outline structure to a page</h1>
    <p>Headings are important for search engines to understand the structure and content of a page. 
        They are also important for screen reader users.</p>

    <h2>Headings should be used in order</h2>
    HTML is like a skeleton for a web page. The default style of headings is not very pretty.
    We will cover how to style headings in a later chapter.

    <h2>Headings should be used in order</h2>
    <p>Headings should be used in order. 
        This is the most important heading, 
        and should be used for the main heading of the page. 
        This is a subheading, and should be used for the main sections of the page. 
        You can see that the source code formating
        is not reflected in the HTML page. 
        To really enforec a line break<br>
        you need to use the br tag.<br>
    </p>
     With the pre tag you can format the text in the source code and it will be reflected in the HTML page.
     <pre>
        This is now

        exactly formated
        as you
        type it here...
     </pre>
     <h3>This section will show you lists</h3>
        <p>Lists are important for structuring content. 
            There are two types of lists in HTML: unordered lists and ordered lists. 
            Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, 
            for example a shopping list. 
            Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, 
            for example a recipe.</p>
        <h4>Unordered lists</h4>
        <p>Unordered lists are created with the ul element. 
            Each item in the list is placed inside a li element. 
            The list items are marked with bullets (typically small black circles).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Ordered lists</h4>
        <p>Ordered lists are created with the ol element. 
            Each item in the list is placed inside a li element. 
            The list items are marked with numbers by default.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Definition lists</h4>
        <p>Definition lists are created with the dl element. 
            Each item in the list is placed inside a dt element (for the term being defined) or a dd element (for the definition).</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Term 1</dt>
            <dd>Definition 1</dd>
            <dt>Term 2</dt>
            <dd>Definition 2</dd>
            <dt>Term 3</dt>
            <dd>Definition 3</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>Lists can be nested</h4>
        <p>Lists can be nested inside each other. 
            This is useful for lists of related items. 
            For example, a list of ingredients for a recipe could be nested inside an ordered list.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2
                <ul>
                    <li>Item 2.1</li>
                    <li>Item 2.2</li>
                    <li>Item 2.3</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>This section will show you links</h3>
        <p>Links are created with the a element. 
            The text between the opening and closing a tags is the link text. 
            The value of the href attribute is the URL of the link.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link to Google</a></p>
        <p>Links can also be created to other pages on the same site. 
            This is called an internal link. 
            Internal links are useful for creating a navigation menu for a website.</p>
        <p><a href="index.htm">This is an internal link to the index page</a></p>
        <p>Links can also be created to other parts of the same page. 
            This is called an anchor link. 
            Anchor links are useful for creating a table of contents for a long page.</p>
        <p><a href="#section1">This is an anchor link to the section 1 heading</a></p>
        <h3>This section will show you images</h3>
        <p>Images are created with the img element. 
            The value of the src attribute is the URL of the image. 
            The value of the alt attribute is the alternative text for the image. 
            The alternative text is used by screen readers for blind users, 
            and is also displayed if the image fails to load.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" alt="Google logo"></p>
        <h3>This section will show you tables</h3>
        <p>Tables are created with the table element. 
            Each row in the table is created with the tr element. 
            Each cell in the table is created with the td element. 
            The th element is used for the table header.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Column 1</th>
                <th>Column 2</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
                <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
                <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
            </tr>       
        </table>
        <h3>This section will show you forms</h3>
