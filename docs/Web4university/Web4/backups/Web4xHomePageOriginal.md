# What is Web4?

Let's start with what the EU understands about it and why 
  * it wants to „not only catch up in digitalisation“ 
  * but „take back the lead“ in it:


For your convenience, it is recommended to open the **links** in a **new tab**. GitHub Wiki does not yet support this feature...

## INTRODUCTION

[Explain it to me in simple slides](https://github.com/web4x/codingWeb4/blob/main/docs/Web4university/Web4/slides/WEB%204.x%20Presentation.pdf)

First and foremost Web 4.0 is a paradigm shift, like always when we assign a new major version number to something like e.g. previously Industry 4.0.

Web 4.0 is a paradigm shift in **software development** and especially in the software development for THE WEB.

THE WEB is the largest software environment that mankind created, yet still the fundamental models to create it are mainly 30 years old and older. 
Around 2010 we found **[The Last Architecture](http://donges.it/tla-visually-explained/)** which makes **IT an Business Architecture perfectly aligned**. It helps to structure how we do software development in a way the Universe is structured intrinsically instead of opposing human architecture on it. 

**Web 4.0** is the **reference implementation** of **[The Last Architecture](http://donges.it/tla-visually-explained/)** that enables to build **Digital Twins** of **Things** from the real world to be represented in a **Simulation of a Service based Economy**.

**Web 4.0** makes THE WEB for the first time **object oriented** and **service oriented** NATIVELY. This enables us to blend the Digital Twins of the virtual worlds (2D and 3D) into the real world. **Borderless** across vendors, technologies, data centres and other silos. Seamless via drag & drop. Just as natural as using **just your hand** in the real world.

Already in 2007 [Kevin Kelly](https://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_kelly_the_next_5_000_days_of_the_web?language=en) knew that we would have to restructure the architecture of THE WEB at some point in time, yet he thought we would create a large  **Database of Things**, but what we really have to do is to make **Things to serve us** in our daily live! And we need to make the **Things** sustainable to our environment. 

Thus Web 4.0 is also the start of the **[Sustainability Revolution](https://github.com/web4x/codingWeb4/wiki/Web-4.x-is-Sustainability-Revolution)** that follows the **Industrial & Digital Revolution** 

## Elevator Statements about Web 4.x

Web 4.x **bridges** the current **separated worlds** of THE WEB, [THE Metaverse](https://ecoverse.com/space/davos24), and "Real World Things". 
As THE Web becomes object oriented naively, [WebObjects become Digital Twins](https://github.com/web4x/codingWeb4/blob/982a1d662f6445c02f41f4755c459a71679f1b83/docs/Web4university/Web4/slides/DAL_Smart_Security_FINAL.pdf) of "[Real World Things](https://test.wo-da.de/EAMD.ucp/Components/com/DAL/EAM/layer5/VTE/2.4.2/src/assets/videos/DAL-Mining.mp4)".
Like "Real World Things" you can grab them and drag and drop them around and use them in different contexts.
You can grab them 
- with your hand
- your finger
- your mouse
- your VR-Controller

and move them in 
- between **different Web Sites** on different Web Domains, 
- between **different devices** like Desktop, iPad, Phone and VR/AR Glasses
- between **different operating system technologies** like Mac OS, android, iOS, Windows, Linux, Unix, ...
- between **different vendors** like Apple, Google, Samsung, Facebok/Meta, Amazon, Microsoft 

It feels as natural in **all worlds** as in the **real world**.

Instead of **"copying"** a Contact, Document or Shop Product, you **share** it via [drag & drop](https://youtu.be/KYgQiYFxyF8) and co-work on the **same thing**.
The **same thing** is always a WebObject, a Digital Twin owned by **one identified** real-life **[person](https://www.dal-identity.com/)** shared with whomever he wants to share it for collaboration. And the **one person** can always **withdraw consent for sharing** and take its own thing back under his own control.

There will be no longer fake people and fake accounts and fake information. Just owned real world things moved around in borderless digital worlds.

### [Developer Access](https://github.com/web4x/codingWeb4/wiki/Web-4.x-Developer-Access) 
The the [Reference Implementation](https://bitbucket.org/donges/eamd.ucp/src/master/) is hosted on [Atlassian](https://2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/294846488/Web+4.0).

Its fully open source, but the developer account on the tooling is not for free by [Atlassian](https://2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/294846488/Web+4.0).

Join [this payed Meetup Group](https://github.com/web4x/codingWeb4/wiki/Web4.x-Home) to be granted full access to **the Atlassian tool suite** and the [Web 4.x](https://2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/294846488/Web+4.0) [Reference Implementation](https://bitbucket.org/donges/eamd.ucp/src/master/).

### Why 4.0

This is a little longer story worth of its own page: 
[From Kondratiev to CMM Semantic Versioning](https://github.com/web4x/codingWeb4/wiki/Why-4.0)

# The actual paradigm shifts

1. Starting point of the Sustainability Revolution
   1. Manufacturing Age -> Industrial Revolution
   1. Industrial Age -> Digital Revolution
   1. Digital Age -> Sustainability Revolution
1. Dezentral Ownership
   * Who owns the Internet?
   * Who owns the Web 1.0 ... 2.0 ... [3.0](https://webfour.io/#/) ... WE REALIZED THAT THE WEB 3.0 IS UNFORTUNATELY A CENTRALIZED ENTITY WITH A DIFFERENT LABEL.
     - Since this official Web4x site gained attention the page https://webfour.io/#/ has been taken offline voluntarily. What a pitty. The discovery of Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk was spot on...but seemingly either no one cared or had the balls to do it right.
   * [You are the Web](https://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_kelly_the_next_5_000_days_of_the_web?language=en)
1. [Object orientation](https://dev.wo-da.de/RAW/videos/UCP/UCP.mp4) vs [Functional world view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwXa7Cvfr8) (1969 first time ever, 2019 in the Web)
   * Visual Component Development (and non-visiual similar to smallTalk, Delphi, JavaBeans)
1. Digital Twins (2001 first time ever)
   * at Royal Mail Postal Distribution Center London
1. Self Sovereign Digital Identities (2024 first time ever)
   * [dal-identity.com](https://dal-identity.com)

   * Components as originally defined with clear lifecycle and the ability to load and restore state across runtimes.
   * MVC based DefaultComponent Just In Time Generation from JSON Particles
   * WebComponents
     1. simulations for older Browsers as WebBeans
     2. WebBean WebComponent integration
   * JSON Particles and Waves for reactive programming
   * The Successionpropagraph based on JSON Particle and Wave functions to eliminate copies
   * CORBA IOR (Internet Object Reference) style linked WebObjects
   * abandoning all separation of data and logic
   * radical separation of concerns
1. EAMD.ucp Repository for programming language independent organisation of the Internet of Services
1. Thinglish - a set of programming language extensions to enable runtime type-save reflective versioned component programming which we simply call Things
1. ONCE kernel that acts as distributed runtime and dynamic component loader
   * OSGi but simple
   * CORBA ORB but cutting edge 
1. WODA a Web 4.0 everything app
   * Write ONCE, Deploy Anywhere
   * device agnostic
   * responsive

     1. Overview
     1. Details
     1. Actions
   * Sandbox
   * IDE
   * Template App
1. Not reinventing the wheels but
   * maximal minimalisation of required concepts (like RISC)
   * radical CMM 4 [enforcement](https://github.com/web4x/codingWeb4/wiki/Why-4.0#web-40-is-the-consequent-application-of-cmm-4-methods)
