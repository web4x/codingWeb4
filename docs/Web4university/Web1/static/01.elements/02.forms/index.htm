        <h3>This section will show you forms</h3>
        <p>Forms are created with the form element. 
            The action attribute is the URL of the page that will process the form. 
            The method attribute is either get or post. 
            The get method is used for forms that don't change anything on the server, 
            for example a search form. 
            The post method is used for forms that do change something on the server, 
            for example a login form.</p>
        <form action="https://www.google.com/search" method="get">
            <input type="text" name="q">
            <input type="submit" value="Search">
        </form>

        <h3>This section will show you forms with post method</h3>
        The post method is used for forms that do change something on the server,
        but in this case we will produce an error 405 because 
        the server does not accept post requests.
        <form action="https://www.google.com/search" method="post">
            <input type="text" name="q">
            <input type="submit" value="Search">
        </form>
